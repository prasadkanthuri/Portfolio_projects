## üí° Idea & Motivation

When shopping online, it's common to waste **10‚Äì20 minutes** reading user reviews to decide whether a product is worth it.

- You manually skim through 50‚Äì100 reviews.
- You may miss key complaints or praises.
- It‚Äôs time-consuming and not scalable for smart shopping.

**ReviewPulse** aims to solve this using **automation + deep learning**.

---

## üöÄ What It Does

- Scrapes up to **200 latest reviews** from any Flipkart product.
- Uses **BART Transformer model** to summarize reviews by sentiment:
  - üü¢ Positive  
  - üî¥ Negative  
  - üü° Neutral
- Calculates **cosine similarity** between:
  - Each sentiment‚Äôs original reviews and their summary.
  - Helps evaluate **summary quality**.
- Gives a **final summary verdict** using all sentiments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### üîó Step 1: URL Input
You paste any valid **Flipkart product URL**.

### ü§ñ Step 2: Review Scraping
- Extracts `product ID` and forms review page link.
- Uses **Selenium** to:
  - Launch a headless browser.
  - Sort by **Most Recent**.
  - Collect up to **200 reviews** across multiple pages.

### üßº Step 3: Data Cleaning
- Extracts:
  - Review Title  
  - Full Review Content  
  - Rating (1‚Äì5 stars)
- Removes **emojis** using the `emoji` Python package.

### üè∑Ô∏è Step 4: Sentiment Classification
- **4‚Äì5 stars** ‚Üí Positive  
- **1‚Äì2 stars** ‚Üí Negative  
- **3 stars** ‚Üí Neutral

### üß† Step 5: Summarization using Transformers
- Uses **Facebook‚Äôs BART Large CNN model**:
  - Summarizes each group (positive/negative/neutral) separately.
  - Then combines all three summaries to generate the **final verdict**.

### üìê Step 6: Summary Evaluation
- Uses **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity** to compare:
  - Original reviews (per sentiment)  
  - ‚¨Ñ  
  - Summarized output
- Helps quantify how much the summary reflects the full data.

### üñºÔ∏è Step 7: Visual Output

Built using **Gradio** with custom CSS:
- üì∑ Product Image
- üìä Review Stats:
  - Total count  
  - Avg rating  
  - # of Positive / Negative / Neutral reviews
- üìà Cosine Similarity (for each sentiment)
- üìö Summary Tabs for each sentiment
- üß† Final Verdict (combined summarization)

## üì¶ Why 200 Reviews?

- Balances **speed and quality**:  
  Too many reviews = slower response, more repetition.  
  200 offers a **representative snapshot**.
- For most products, recent 200 reviews are enough to:
  - Catch common issues  
  - Understand general sentiment

---

## üß™ Cosine Similarity Use

Cosine Similarity is computed between:
- All positive reviews ‚ÜîÔ∏è their summary  
- All negative reviews ‚ÜîÔ∏è their summary  
- All neutral reviews ‚ÜîÔ∏è their summary  

> **Higher the score (closer to 1), better the summary coverage.**
